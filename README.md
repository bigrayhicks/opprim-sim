Opportunity-Enabled Risk Management (OPPRIM) Simulator
=========

Welcome to OPPRIM SIM, a Java project for trust and risk management simulation, where opportunities are possible in addition to threats. Nowadays Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) and mobile work are a reality even if they challenge traditional risk management that mainly focuses on the threats that these mobile opportunities create. They do not consider their potential benefits, e.g., if a user cannot work when being paid while waiting 2 hours at the airport then the productivity is lower. This is the main reason that we introduce a new risk management model, called OPPRIM, where opportunities are also taken into account. Different OPPRIM metrics are possible and we have built this simulator to help creating the best OPPRIM metric as possible, resistant to attacks while allowing the users to reap the benefits of their opportunities.
